We were tinkering around with a new wine that we sourced from a rugged volcanic vineyard in the Red Hills of Lake County California. We were reminiscing about our fathers, and it reminded me of how my Dad used to tinker around the garage, rebuilding old stock cars with his friends.
<br/><br/>That rich, approachable wine that we tried back then defines the style and quality that we try to replicate each vintage at Josh Cellars, wines that are bold and expressive, but unassuming and approachable. Funny how it reminds me of someone. My Dad’s name was Joseph, as is mine, but his friends just called him Josh.” – Joseph Carr, Founder
 <br/><br/>
“My dad was a soldier in the US Army and a volunteer firefighter in our hometown, things that influence my life today and the charities we work with every year.” <a href="community" style="color:#e4d0b0;font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Click here</a> to learn more.</p>
<h1 class="lightR">OUR FOUNDER</h1>
 <p style="margin-bottom:3.0em">After a decade serving as a world-class sommelier followed by another decade as a wine industry executive, Joseph Carr set out on his own in 2005 to form his family-owned wine company. It was, as Joseph Carr says, “a chance to follow a dream.”
   <img src="images/Josh-Cellars-Founder-Joseph-Carr.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Joe Carr Josh Vintage Photo" style="max-width:33%;float:left;padding:0.5em"> <br/><br/>Influenced by the wines of Bordeaux and Burgundy, Joseph Carr began making wines under a label bearing his name with a winemaking philosophy emphasizing balance, sophistication and approachability. Old world in style, but expressive of California’s best winegrowing regions, the Joseph Carr line of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is sourced from select vineyards in Rutherford, Oakville and the Stags Leap District, and the Chardonnay from the Sonoma Coast.
    <br/><br/>In 2007, Joseph launched Josh Cellars, wines that represent the best of California: bold, rich wines that are approachable and balanced. Sourced from across many great California winegrowing regions, every vintage represents a labor of love, a commitment to quality, and a very personal promise to make great wine, in honor of his dad, Josh.
    <br/><br/>Joseph lives with his wife Dee, dog Molly and frequently gets visits from his daughter Cailen at their home in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. He splits his time between the Cape and Napa, “a rough gig,” he admits with a smirk.
